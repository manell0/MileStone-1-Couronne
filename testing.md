## Testing User Stories

### New/Potential Fans Goals:

1. As a new user, I want to easily navigate through the website to find the relevant content, effortlessly.

   - The navigation bars (Top nav bar and footer) is clearly defined and easily navigable for users to find and use.

   - The header on the top left of each page is explanatory and clear on all pages.

2. As a new user, I want to learn more about the classic board game couronne in order to better understand the rules and history.

   - The 'rules' and 'styry' pages is appropriately named for users wishing to find out about the game.
   - The 'rule' and 'story' pages is easily found on each page, no matter the device.

3. As a new user, I want to easily navigate to the artist's social links in order to keep up with the latest news.

   - The social links are located in the footer on desktop and tablet devices.
   - In each instance, each link is represented by an appropriate icon for easy identification of the social platform.

4. As a new user, I want to be able to watch an embedded video to be able to get a snapshot of the game .

## User Testing

Family members were asked to review the site and documentation to point out any bugs and/or user experience issues. Their helpful advice throughout the process led to many UX changes in order to create a better experience.

- Change to the Navbar text size on mobiles in order for the toggler menu icon to more distinguishable.

- Decided that footer should also (as top navigation bar) be fixed because it is much better for the UX.
