## User Testing

Family members were asked to review the site and documentation to point out any bugs and/or user experience issues. Their helpful advice throughout the process led to many UX changes in order to create a better experience.

- Change to the Navbar text size on mobiles in order for the menu icon to more distinguishable.

- Decided that footer should also (as top navigation bar) be fixed because it is much better for the UX.
