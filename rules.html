				Hi Svante, Did you know that one of the most common causes of a failing project is invalid code? It is, however,
				also one of the most easily avoided failures as the code validators you learned about in the LMS can check your
				code and highlight any errors. When validating your code, it is important to remember to check all the files in
				your project and to check that your project works on multiple browsers and screen sizes. The validators allow
				you to check the project URLs, upload the files or even paste in the code. A passing project needs error-free
				code, but warnings are acceptable. If you are aiming for a high grade and time permits, then consider acting on
				the warnings too. Remember to document any errors you found and how you fixed them in the README testing
				write-up. You should also check that all of your user stories are satisfied and include a screenshot in the
				README to show what that looks like in your application. If you have reused code from the course or elsewhere in
				your project, be sure to include a comment to attribute this, so the assessor knows not to assess it. Best of
				luck, The Code Institute Assessment Team
