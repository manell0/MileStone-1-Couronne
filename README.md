# Introduction

This little site was designed mainly for nerds who already like the board game couronne.
Since the site is simple and minimal, I also hope to attract people who like board games in general

The focus of the website is to create an easy way to access the rules of the classic board game couronne. The story behind the game is also on this page as customer surveys have shown that it is interesting.

- The simplicity and small scale of the website is an important aspect to achieve an interest in bookmarking the page for return. Above all, rules are something you want to have easily accessible.
- As a former pool player, I know that easy access is crucial. It was not uncommon for the website for rules and history to be visited during ongoing matches and pool tournaments.

This is the first of four Milestone projects that the developer must complete during his Full Stack web development program at The Code Institute.

The most important requirements were to create a responsive and static website with at least three pages, mainly [**HTML5**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML5) and [**CSS3**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS).

- The site is for board game geeks who want to improve in that genre.

- Users who find this website are most certainly one who is looking for just and precisely rules and history for the board game couronne.

#### A scope was defined into two categories:

- ##### Content Requirements

  - The user will be looking for:
    - Rules of the game
    - History Information
    - Contact details
    - Social Links

- ##### Functionality Requirements
  - The user will be able to:
    - Easily navigate through the site in order to find the information they want.

The information architecture was organized in a hierarchial tree structure in order to ensure that users could navigate through the site with ease and efficiency, with the following results:
![Hierarchial tree structure](assets/images/couronne-structure.png)

### Skeleton

Wireframe mockups were created in a Figma Workspace with providing a positive user experience in mind:

### Surface

[Here comes the Markup](http://ami.responsivedesign.is/)

## Design

### Color Scheme

The main colours used throughout the website are a mixture of Blue, Some brown and White with gray/blue accents.

The chosen color scheme is a reflection of the nerdy little group expected to use this site.

### Typography

The pairing of the fonts Open Sans and Exo 2 is used throughout the website with Sans Serif as the fallback font in case of import failure.

### Picture

The background image is a blurred image to get some color on the page.

The selected image on the home page is modern and simple, reflecting the look and feel of the page and the game.
The image is captivating and visually represents the site's theme.

The pictures on the rules and story pages are some pictures I found online that have a Creative Commons license

- The images provides alternative text to use if the element cannot be reproduced.

# Features

### Design Features

Each page of the website features a consistent responsive navigational system:

-At the top of all pages there is a navigation bar that is fixed for easy navigation on the site.

- On larger screens, the header contains some advertising text that disappears on mobile devices. The footer contains appropriate social media icons that link users to Couronne's main pages. For mobile devices, the header and footer are slightly modified.

#### Home Page, Rules Page and the History Page

- The Home, Rule and History Page is divided into two columns on desktops and one column on mobile devices.
  On mobile devices, all content is stacked in a column.
  The Rules Page and the History Page have an back button for easy navigation to the page you visit last.

#### Contact Page

- [ ] The contact page is unchanged regardless of the size of devices used. In addition to the header (see above).

- [ ] Contact Form - The form is not validated.
  - Depending on the time, maybe I just make the contact link only to ba a meil to link ....

### Existing Features

#### Header Logo

#### Header Navigation Bar

- Appearing on every page for a consistently easy and intuitive navigable system.

#### Social Icons

- Social Icons - The icons appear on each page and are appropriate representations of the social media platforms.

## Features to Implement in the future

- [ ] Make the contact page a separate page where you can write a message directly on the site and not just an email to link

- ### Merchandise Shop

- #### Feature
  - set up an shop where the Couronne can sell their merchandise directly to couronne players online.
  - #### Reason for not featuring in this release
    - JavaScript and/or Python needed to implemented.

# Issues and Bugs

- My mentor thought I should make my first suggestion a little more fansy, so I set up the navigation bar at the top to make the page a little more spacious.
  So now I have two variants of my page. And it has taken a lot of my time!

- Had difficulty getting my footer in place. Took help from google and found Dominic Fraser. [The fix page](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-keep-your-footer-where-it-belongs-59c6aa05c59c/)
